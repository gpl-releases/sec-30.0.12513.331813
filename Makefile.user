# RULE TO GENERATE C FILE DEPENDENCIES
#
# All .d files go into deps/ subdirectory
#
# NOTE: -MM flag (unlike -M) omits dependencies on system header files.
#
# NOTE: sed command creates depency of BOTH .d and .o files on source files,
# so BOTH are rebuilt if any dependency changes. E.g., translates:
#       x.o: x.c x.h
# into:
#       x.o deps/x.d: x.c x.h
